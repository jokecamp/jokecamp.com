  <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
  <li>Mars Exploration</li>
  <li>Living off the grid</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="in-the-future">In the Future</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We will not drive our own cars. We will not even own our own cars.</li>
  <li>People will no longer need routers and cable modems. Internet will just be in the air.</li>
  <li>We will share more things.</li>
  <li>Will will not need blinds. Windows will just tint.</li>
  <li>Will everything break?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tiny-letter-newsletter-for-fantasy-sports-managers">Tiny Letter Newsletter for fantasy sports managers</h2>

<p>Generate a letter for league managers.</p>

<h2 id="maps-with-noise-pollution">Maps with Noise Pollution</h2>

<p>Useful for movers looking for a new place. I am sure this exists.</p>

<h2 id="football-data-newsletter">Football Data Newsletter</h2>

<p>Create a weekly newsletter highlighting football data sets, APIs and open source applications and websites. Tutorials.</p>

<p>Steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create Name/logo/website
– football data report (http://www.leandomainsearch.com/search?q=football+data+report)
– https://withoomph.com logo generator</li>
  <li>Create signup form / landing page
– http://getbootstrap.com/examples/cover/</li>
  <li>
    <p>Example Newsletter</p>
  </li>
  <li>https://github.com/architv/soccer-cli</li>
  <li>http://www.pena.lt/y/</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="catch-me-up-movie-website">“Catch Me Up” Movie Website</h2>

<p>A website that allows a movie viewer that needs a plot refresher or if they started watching a movie half-way through they can get the crib notes for what they missed. The website would show a list of movie plot lines and all will be obscured by spoiler tags. Each line of plot details will have an associated minute. The user will be able to reveal the plot lines they want to see.</p>

<h2 id="image-depot">Image Depot</h2>

<p>Buy image rights with very small amounts of bitcoins or stellar. We are talking fractions of a penny.</p>

<h2 id="cheatcrib-sheet-for-areas-of-expertise">Cheat/Crib Sheet for Areas of Expertise</h2>

<p>A pocket sized cheat sheet to print out explaining a specific subject. For example a small printout for baseball explaining the most basic rules and facts plus a few small trivia pieces. A way for someone to quickly get a summary of a subject in order to have a conversation about the topic.</p>

<h2 id="sports-scores-website-with-spoiler-alerts">Sports Scores website with Spoiler Alerts</h2>

<p>I tried this once for the EPL but struggled to find a free reliable API source.</p>

<h2 id="api-securityhacker-game">API Security/Hacker Game</h2>

<p>A game that has developers try to hack into APIs. It would be a fun way of teaching API security. There are many security games already out there but this one would be focused on APIs.</p>

<h2 id="crowd-source-live-sports-scores-api">Crowd Source Live Sports Scores API</h2>

<p>You have to pay for a live sports scores API. What if we created a free API that was populated by the consumers who in turn use the live scores. There could be endpoints for reporting game events. When a game event has enough reports to be considered accurate it would be returned in the API as an verified event. This is basically how the big sports data companies get there data but they rely on about two people per game. A free API would have the world available for reporting. In order to pay for its own hosting maybe it could charge for web-hooks on live events or donations.</p>

<h2 id="social-media-newsletter">Social Media Newsletter</h2>

<p>Allow people to sign up for a weekly newsletter that shows them a summary of what has happened on facebook and twitter while they were away. This might be more popular if the backlash from an “always online” presence continues.</p>

<h2 id="travel-calendar-and-planning">Travel Calendar and Planning</h2>

<p>A flexible calendar for trip planning. Have a structure that helps determine you have a place to sleep every night and also saves ideas for things to do.</p>

<h2 id="sports-checksum-api">Sports Checksum API</h2>

<p>With the emergence of sports data it would be nice to have an community agreed upon set of checksum data that you can use to prove the accuracy of your results. It would simply have some basic summary stats on events in the post. That way you could say does your API return 58 points for 2014 Manchester United season? If yes then your API passes the checksum and is considered accurate.</p>

<h2 id="rotten-tv">Rotten TV</h2>

<p>A simple website that tracks just how rotten the movies are that are playing on network movie channels. A running score of all rotten tomato scores for each channel would be funny.</p>
