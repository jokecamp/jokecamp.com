  <h1 class="post-title">Building a Raspberry Pi Photo Frame</h1>
  <span class="post-date">07 Jun 2014</span>
  <p>First off, my inspiration and instructions came from this article <a href="http://www.ofbrooklyn.com/2014/01/2/building-photo-frame-raspberry-pi-motion-detector">Building a living photo frame with a Raspberry Pi and a motion detector</a>. The author is more knowledgeable and the article is more in-depth than mine. See that article for specific configuration and for the actual contents of the python script to pull photos from flickr. I hope my post will help others by sharing my first time experiences with the pi and the issues/frustrations I encountered.</p>

<h2>The shopping list</h2>

<p>Purchased from <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1 x Raspberry Pi Model A 256MB RAM[ID:1344] = $29.95</p></li>
<li><p>1 x RCA coupler - Male to Male[ID:951] = $1.50</p></li>
<li><p>1 x Miniature WiFi (802.11b/g/n) Module: For Raspberry Pi and more[ID:814] = $11.95</p></li>
<li><p>1 x NTSC/PAL (Television) TFT Display - 3.5&quot; Diagonal[ID:913] = $44.95</p></li>
<li><p>1 x PIR (motion) sensor[ID:189] = $9.95</p></li>
<li><p>1 x 4GB SD card for Raspberry Pi preinstalled with Raspbian Wheezy[ID:1121] = $9.95</p></li>
<li><p>1 x Micro USB cable - free - I used an old phone power charger to power the pi board</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A total of about $120 after taxes. Expensive for a digital picture frame but relatively cheap after for a hobby.</p>

<h2>My issues and frustrations</h2>

<p><strong>My WIFI dongle is finicky</strong>. It only works when I insert it half-way and it will often drop the connection. I knew when it was working by watching for the flashing blue light. When the light turns a solid blue light the connection no longer works. This was my must frustrating experience. I am unsure if the root of the issue is software, the dongle, or the actual pi. I hope to replace the dongle soon and also try some pi firmware upgrades.</p>

<p><strong>A bluetooth keyboard and mouse did not work with the pi.</strong> The pi would miss key presses and stutter. The devices were running low on power and the bluetooth was a bad idea. The solution was to use a basic wired USB keyboard and mouse. I ended up picking up a basic USB splitter for about $12. After reading up it looks like there are a lot of advocates for USB hubs with independent power sources but I was hoping to keep not introduce a cumbersome USB hub.</p>

<p><strong>Remoting into the pi from my mac was tricky at first</strong>. I needed to find the pi&#39;s ip address and in my case I needed to do this without having access to the pi. In the end I did this by logging into the remote administration web console for my wireless router. From there I could see a list of connected devices via the &quot;DHCP Reservations&quot; section. Once you have the ip it as a simple as opening the mac terminal and running [code]ssh pi@192.168.1.125[/code] then entering the password.</p>

<p><strong>The LDC screen was too small for dev work.</strong> After connecting everything and powering on the pi I realized that my 3.5 inch display was going to be too small to read anything. It was a bit anticlimactic and ended my development work for the day. <strong>Roadblocks that ended the days work were common</strong>. Be prepared to have to wait a few days for new parts or to research. I ended up connecting my pi directly to my TV in the living room via my really long HDMI cable. This made it readable but a bit hard and impractical for working on. Luckily, I only needed to use the TV until I could get the WIFI dongle setup. Once connected to the local network I could switch to controlling the pi via my mac laptop using SSH.</p>

<p><strong>Getting familiar with UNIX</strong>. Some common commands I utilized:</p>

<ul>
<li>sudo reboot</li>
<li>sudo halt</li>
<li>raspi-config - menu for setting common pi settings. It looks like a BIOS menu</li>
<li>startx - start the GUI. I ended up using the terminal more</li>
<li>df -h - check the disk space</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Installing the dependent software</strong> to power the python script to download the flickr photos.
Install <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a> a python package manager. We will need the flickrarpi and requests packages.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">wget https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
sudo python get-pip.py
# ready to install the packages
sudo pip install flickrapi
sudo pip install requests
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Installing fbi - frame buffer imageviewer</strong>. This is the program that actually displays the slideshow.
<code>sudo apt-get install fbi</code> Once fbi is running you can kill it by getting the pid with <code>pidof fbi</code> and then killing it by <code>kill #pid</code> where #pid is the process id.</p>

<h2>Fully Operational!</h2>

<p>The slideshow is operational now and pulling images directly from my flickr stream. I still have some work to do with a proper display and fixing my wifi issues but the project has been very satisfying. It was fun to make something tangible again. As I have been writing this post I have been quite distracted. Distracted by my new pi slideshow.</p>
