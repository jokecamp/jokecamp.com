A few of the projects I've been working on...

 - Architected and built a Digital Asset Management System to handle millions of media assets.

 - Architected and built a distributed microservices orchestrator system to streamline media encoding pipelines for broadcast and podcast production.

 - Content Production Appications for the newsroom.

 - [A Treehouse](../blog/building-a-tree-house) - My favorite project. I will still be reminding my kids twenty years later, "Remember that treehouse I built for you...?" (Summer 2021)
 
 - [PaulTenwalde.com](http://www.paultenwalde.com/) - Uses the [flickr API](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/) with PHP. Caching results and creating a photo gallery with jQuery. Built with a focus on unobtrusive javascript, clean html and CSS. Due for a design refresh. You could date this by the retro design.

- [Travel Log](http://travellogjoe.blogspot.com/) - travel pictures of my backpacking trip in 2008/2009.
